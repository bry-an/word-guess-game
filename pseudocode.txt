Variables:
guesses = number of initial blanks
Wins = count of wins
Losses = count of losses
answerStr = raw answer as one string
answerSpl = Answer split into array of single-character strings
Blanks = number of blanks remaining
userPress = key pressed

Question = response.question
Blanks = for each letter i, display blank
	else, display character, space, etc



JSON parsing:
answerStr = string answer; response.answer
answerSpl = split answer for program


Pseudocode:
Every time a key pressed:
IF gameStatus == false:
	Fetch JSON file for question
	Display question, corresponding number of blanks, difficulty, and category.
	Display intro screen (press key to begin)
	gameStatus == true;
	remove intro screen

IF gameStatus == true:

For each character in answerSpl
	Blanks++

Guesses = blanks
Append blank image to webpage

IF answerSpl.indexOf(userPress) == -1
	THEN guesses--
	ELSE replace corresponding blank with letter, blanks--

IF guesses == 0, end game (gameStatus==off), losses ++
If blanks == 0, end game (gameStatus==off), wins++
